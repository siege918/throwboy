# throwboy

This project was a Gameboy-style action adventure game I was working on for a while, focused on picking up and throwing objects.

I didn't get very far in making it (only the basics really), but I don't forsee myself coming back to it. I'm releasing the source code with the MIT license so that I can move forward.

I doubt anyone will find much use in it, but I'd prefer it to be out there in this unpolished proof-of-concept state than languishing in my private repos.
